# Pricing and Support

---

# [How AWS Pricing Works](#how-aws-pricing-works)

AWS offers a range of cloud computing services with pay-as-you-go pricing. 

**Categories:**
1. **Pay for what you use.** For each service, you pay for exactly the amount of resources that you actually use, without requiring long-term contracts or complex licensing. 
2. **Pay less when you reserve.** Some services offer reservation options that provide a significant discount compared to On-Demand Instance pricing.
3. **Pay less with volume-based discounts when you use more.** Some services offer tiered pricing, so the per-unit cost is incrementally lower with increased usage.

---

# [AWS Pricing Calculator](#aws-pricing-calculator)

**[The AWS Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/) lets you explore AWS services and create an estimate for the cost of your use cases on AWS.**

You can organize your AWS estimates by groups that you define. A group can reflect how your company is organized, such as providing estimates by cost center.

---

# [AWS Pricing Examples](#aws-pricing-examples)

## [AWS Lambda Pricing](#aws-lambda-pricing)

- You are charged based on the number of requests for your functions and the time that it takes for them to run.
- **1 million free requests** and up to **3.2 million seconds** of compute time per month.

You can save on AWS Lambda costs by signing up for a Compute Savings Plan. **A Compute Savings Plan offers lower compute costs in exchange for committing to a consistent amount of usage over a 1-year or 3-year term.** This is an example of **paying less when you reserve**. 

---

## [AWS EC2 Pricing](#aws-ec2-pricing)

- You pay for only the compute time that you use while your instances are running.
- For some workloads, you can significantly reduce Amazon EC2 costs by using Spot Instances. *For example, suppose that you are running a batch processing job that is able to withstand interruptions.*
- You can find additional cost savings for Amazon EC2 by considering Savings Plans and Reserved Instances.

---

## [AWS S3 Pricing](#aws-s3-pricing)

Consider the following cost components.

### [1. Storage](#1-storage)

You pay for only the storage that you use. You are charged based on:
- the objects' sizes
- storage classes
- how long you have stored each object during the month.

### [2. Request and data retrievals](#2-request-and-data-retrievals)

You pay for requests made to your Amazon S3 objects and buckets.

### [3. Data transfer](#3-data-transfer)

There is **no cost** to transfer data between different Amazon S3 buckets or from Amazon S3 to other services within the same AWS Region.

You **pay for data that you transfer into and out of Amazon S3**, with a few exceptions.

There is **no cost for data transferred into Amazon S3 from the internet or out to Amazon CloudFront**. 

There is also **no cost for data transferred out to an Amazon EC2 instance in the same AWS Region as the Amazon S3 bucket**.

### [4. Management and replication](#4-management-and-replication)

You pay for the storage management features that you have enabled on your accountâ€™s Amazon S3 buckets. These features include Amazon S3 inventory, analytics, and object tagging.

---

For each Region, charges are based on the following factors:
- The number of requests to add or copy objects into a bucket
- The number of requests to retrieve objects from a bucket
- The amount of storage space used.

---

# [Billing Dashboards](#billing-dashboards)

- AWS Organizations is a service that enables you to manage multiple AWS accounts from a central location. AWS Organizations also provides the option for consolidated billing. 
- Consolidated billing  enables you to share volume pricing discounts across accounts. 
- In Amazon S3, after customers have transferred 10 TB of data in a month, they pay a lower per-GB transfer price for the next 40 TB of data transferred.
