# Introduction to Amazon Web Services

# [Client-Server Model](#client-server-model)

In computing, a *client* can be a web browser or desktop application that a person interacts with to make requests to computer servers. A *server* can be services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (**Amazon EC2**), a type of virtual server.

# [Cloud Computing](#cloud-computing)

**Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.**

## [Deployment Models for Cloud Computing](#deployment-models-for-cloud-computing)

* **Cloud-based Deployment**

In a cloud-based deployment model, you can migrate existing applications to the cloud, or you can design and build new applications in the cloud. 

* **On-premises Deployment**

On-premises deployment is also known as a *private* cloud deployment. In this model, resources are deployed on premises by using virtualization and resource management tools.

* **Hybrid Deployment**

In a hybrid deployment, cloud-based resources are connected to on-premises infrastructure.

## [Benefits of Cloud Computing](#benefits-of-cloud-computing)

* **Trade upfront expense for variable expense**

**Upfront expense** refers to data centers, physical servers, and other resources that you would need to invest in before using them. **Variable expense** means you only pay for computing resources you consume.

* **Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers**
* **Stop guessing capacity and paying for unused resources**
* **Benefit from massive economies of scale**

The aggregated cloud usage from a large number of customers results in lower pay-as-you-go prices. 

* **Increase speed and agility**
* **Go global in minutes**

AWS Cloud enables you to deploy applications to customers around the world quickly, while providing them with low latency.
