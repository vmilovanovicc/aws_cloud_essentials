# [Shared Responsibility Model](#shared-responsibility-model)

AWS is responsible for some parts of your environment and you (the customer) are responsible for other parts. This concept is known as the **[shared responsibility model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model)**.

The shared responsibility model divides into:
-  **customer responsibilities** (commonly referred to as “security in the cloud”) and 
- **AWS responsibilities** (commonly referred to as “security of the cloud”).

Customers are responsible for the security of everything that they create and put in the AWS Cloud.
