# Monitoring and Analytics

# [Amazon CloudWatch](#amazon-cloudwatch)

**[Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) is a web service that enables you to monitor and manage various metrics and configure alarm actions based on data from those metrics.**

CloudWatch uses [metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/working_with_metrics.html) to represent the data points for your resources. AWS services send metrics to CloudWatch. 

**With CloudWatch, you can create [alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html) that automatically perform actions if the value of your metric has gone above or below a predefined threshold.** 

**The CloudWatch [dashboard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Dashboards.html) feature enables you to access all the metrics for your resources from a single location.**
